The `br` tag is used to add line breaks in your HTML content.

## Why not just press enter?

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```html
<p>
  This is line one.
  This is              line two.
</p>
```

<div class="px-5 rounded-xl border border-black">
  <p>
    This is line one.
    This is line two.
  </p>
</div>

As you can see in the example above any excess white space including enters are removed from the rendered html.

## Adding line breaks

```html
<p>This is line one.<br />This is line two.</p>
```

<div class="px-5 rounded-xl border border-black">
  <p>
    This is line one.<br />This is line two.
  </p>
</div>

By using the `br` tag you can add a line break that will make it to the rendered html

## Conclusion

The `br` tag is pretty simple with only one use case and that is to add line breaks in your HTML content.
