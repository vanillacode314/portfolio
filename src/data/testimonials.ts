			"I was looking for someone to help refactor a large project. Raqueebuddin was very responsive and demonstrated clear knowledge of all of the technologies in my stack (Svelte, Svelte Kit, Tailwind CSS). We had a brief call to discuss an action plan, and after I gave the go, he started immediately, kept in communication with me, and finished the job within just a few days. I think I'll be contacting him again if I need something else cleaned up, or someone to implement a feature or fix a bug",
